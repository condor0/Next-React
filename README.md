# React Day 1 - Baseline

React SPA scaffolded with Vite, Tailwind, ESLint, and Prettier. The UI starts with a simple app shell (header, sidebar, main) to iterate on.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Scripts

- dev: start the Vite dev server.
- build: typecheck and build for production.
- lint: run ESLint.
- test: placeholder until tests are added.
- format: Prettier check.

## Docs
